Let's talk about the problem first: 
1- In the first second nothing happens.
2- In the second second the whole grid has booms.
3- In the third second the start booms explode.
4- In the fourth second the whole grid has booms.
5- In the fifth second the booms of the second second explode.
6- In the sixth second the whole grid has booms.

So if you noticed that every even second the whole grid has booms.
Another thing you can notice if you assume an example and follow it, 
that it repeats itself every time (3, 7, 11, 15, ...) are exact and (5, 9, 13, 17, ...) are exact.

I created two helper functions:
1- bomberMan_a, to full the grid with booms
2- bomberMan_3, it solves the first explosion at the third second. It equals the result of (3, 7, 11, ...)
, and equals to the reflection of (5, 9, ...) so if the n is a number in this values just call the function twice.

bomberMan_a is called whenever n is even(n % 2 = 0)

bomberMan_3 is called if any other value but not 1:
(n = 1) nothing happens
(n % 4 = 3) call the function bomberMan_3 one time
(n % 4 = 1) call the function bomberMan_3 two times

bomberMan_3 is implemented that i search for the booms('O') and
after that i convert the five cells(Up, Down, Left, Right) to ('x')
but if any of the four cells equals('O') i leave it to change the
four cells around it first then change it.(look the example down)
after that i search for the ('x') and change them into ('.')
(change into clear cells as they have already exploded)
and search for the('.') and convert them into ('O')
(change into boom cells as they filled with booms and did not explode)
