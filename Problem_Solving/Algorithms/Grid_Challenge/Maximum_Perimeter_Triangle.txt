First: sort the array using mergesort algorithm.

Second: As we know, to have a triangle, the sum of any two sticks must be longer than the third one.
As the array is sorted and we search it from the right side, 
any length that is smaller than the previous two elements can create a triangle.

When we find a triangle we break if not the variable i will be 1 (break out for loop) so,
we check if it is 1, means we counld not find a triangle and the flag = 0.
