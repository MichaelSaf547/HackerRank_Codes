start: is the number of the sequence.
search_for: is the number that we are searching for.
i: is a counter over the string in the while loop.
len: is the length of the string.
rest_len: is the length of left charcters in the string. (on the right hand of the i)
number_len: is the length of the search number.
temp: is a string equal to the search_for number.
flag: to indicator the result is it yes or no.

1- If the first charcter is '0', we have leading zero and it is not allowed so flag = 0 and end.
2- Else, the search_for equals start + 1 and the temp equals the string conversion of search_for.
3- Using strstr function try to find the temp in the s string but notice, 
3-1- The searching procss must start from the ith charcter. ("12" 34567891011 "12")
3-2- The result must be the address of the ith element. ("7" "8" 7 "9") it should return 78 so 
	if we neglect that condition it will find the 9 in the string and it might return 7 or no result.
	
4- If the result of the 3- is true make flag = 1, increment the search_for number by one and 
	increment i by the number_len.
5- If the result of the 3- is false check if the flag = 1:
	then the start number is wrong and we need to recreate the start number.
6- If the flag = 0: multiply the start by 10 and add the ith element to the start number.

7- Each time check if the rest_len >= number_len to enable us to search for the number, as we can not find 
	"111" in "11".
