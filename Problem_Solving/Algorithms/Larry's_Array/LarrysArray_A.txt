As we choose 3 consecutive indices so we sum the number of inversions 
and check if the this number % (3 - 1) == zero then the answer is yes
if the this number % (3 - 1) != zero then the answer is no

the number of inversions for {1, 6, 5, 2, 4, 3}:

start with 1: no number on the right is smaller than 1 so the sum equals 0.

6: four numbers on the right are smaller than 6 so the sum equals 4.

5: three numbers on the right are smaller than 5 so the sum equals 7 (4 + 3).

2: no number on the right is smaller than 2 so the sum equals 7.

4: one number on the right is smaller than 4 so the sum equals 8 (7 + 1).

3: no number on the right is smaller than 2 so the sum equals 8.

As the sum = 8, and 8 % 2 = 0. the answer = Yes.
