Create an help array of 1001 element
Loop over the B array to detect which numbers exist in the array, 
and each number increase its position in the help array.

Then loop over the A array check if this number exists in the help array, 
if yes then increase the pairs by one and decrease the existence of that number from the help array, 
if no do nothing.

Then check the pairs if it equals to the length we must decrease it by 1, as the problem statment
said you must change one number. If it is smaller than the length just increase it by 1.
