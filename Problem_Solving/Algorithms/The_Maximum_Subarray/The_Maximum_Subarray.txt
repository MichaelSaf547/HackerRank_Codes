max_negative function: is used to check if all the elements are smaller than 1 
						if all the values are smaller than 1 it returns the max of these values.
						else it returns 1.
						
	Initalize the res with 0x80000000 -the maximum negative value- 
	then check if any digit is greater than 0 break; and return 1
	else search for the max value in the array.
	
	
maxSubarray function: is used to find the sum of all positive values and the max sum of a subset.
						First check if it has positive values or all are negative.
						if all negative then add the returned value in the array, in both locations.
						else, first: sum the positive values in max_positive variable.
							second: sum the value of the ith element in the temp and check it 
							if the temp value is higher than max, put it into the max, and 
							if the temp value goes to zero or negative, set temp to zero as
							no need for all the previous subset.
