1- Check if the length is odd or even: 
	if odd: retuen -1 as we can not devide one string to two strings with the same length.
	
	else even: 
	
		Create 2 arrays of length 26 each represent how many character of each character
		Then choose an array to be converted to the second string and go on the array of this string, 
		if any location on the array is larger than the same location in the second array,
		sum the difference to the res.
