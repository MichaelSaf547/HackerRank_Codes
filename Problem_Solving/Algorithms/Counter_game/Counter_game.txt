If the input is 1 then Louise can not play and Richard win
else, start with i = 63, where i indicates the shifting of 1

then compare n with the 1 << i, we have 3 cases
1- The shifted value is larger than the input so just continue the loop.

Ex: n = 5 --> 0101,  i = 63 --> 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 
so just ignore it and go to i = 62 and continue till this condition is false.


2- They are equal this means that the value is 2 to the power of i. 
  so if i is even 2, 4, 6, ..., do not do anything just break and if it is odd flip the flag then break
  
Ex: n = 16 --> 0001 0000,  i = 4 --> 0001 0000 so 
player make it 8 
second make it 4
player make it 2
second make it 1 and win 
so the value of the flag will stay as it no changes happens as we have even number of plays. 

If it is odd we need to flip it 
Ex: n = 8 --> 0000 1000,  i = 3 --> 0000 1000 so 
player make it 4 
second make it 2
player make it 1 and win 
so the one who was the flag in favor to him loses 

3- The shifted value is smaller than the input so subtract  the input from the shifted value.
 and flip the flag as the player played one time.
notice that the shifted value alwayas has only one 1 in its binary so when the shifted value is smaller this means
that the i has the position of the most significant 1 in the input value and the input value has more ones in it.


Ex: n = 20 --> 0001 0100,  i = 4 --> 0001 0000 
so 20 - 16 = 4 flag is flipped
and continue the loop.
