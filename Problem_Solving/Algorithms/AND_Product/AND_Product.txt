1- Find the difference between the two inputs and if the difference equals 0 return a or b.
2- If the difference is not 0 search for the binary number that handle the difference
Ex: 
a = 10, b = 14 the difference equals 4
10 --> 0000 1010
14 --> 0000 1110 
the binary number is 2 as 2 to the power of 2 equals 4 = the difference
2 here indicates that 2 bits are needed to handle the difference.

and if the difference is not a power of 2 search for the one that is larger 

Ex: 
a = 11, b = 14 the difference equals 3
11 --> 0000 1011
14 --> 0000 1110 
the binary number is 2 as 2 to the power of 2 equals 4 > the difference
2 here indicates that 2 bits are needed to handle the difference.
 
3- Then shift the a value to the right by the i value and shift it to the left again to just make these bits equal 0

4- If the the binary value is larger than the difference value, 
do the same as 3 above, and after this and the a value with b to get the res.
