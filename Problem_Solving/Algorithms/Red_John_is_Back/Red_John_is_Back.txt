fact array: holds the factorial values from Zero to Eight (the maximum needed value in the problem)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nCr function: is used to calculate the nCr value
Inputs: 	1- int, n
			2- int, r
		
Outputs:	1- int, the res

nCr = (n!) / (r! * (n - r)!)

so i ask which number is smaller the r or the n - r, to reduce the factorial value
then i keep multipling the n value with minusing it 1 each time till reach the com value
here i found the value of n! / max(r!, (n - r)!)

then divide the value on the min(r!, (n - r)!) which is already stored in the fact array.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

isPrime function: is used to check either the number is prime or not.
Inputs:		1- int, num

Outputs: 	1- int, res (1 for prime or 0 for not prime)

if the num is smaller than or equal to 1 return 0.
if the num is equal to 2 or 3 return 1.
else starting from 2 till the (square root of the num) + 1 if the num mod 
any digits equals 0 return 0 otherwisie return 1.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

redJohn function: is the core function 
Inputs:		1- int, n the width of the wall.

Outputs: 	1- int, res the number if prime numbers in the sum of possible ways.

sum_of_poss stars with 1 to indicate the way of usinging all as vertical. 
if n < 4 return 0
else, find the division of n over 4 using shifting by 2 to the right.
then loop over the value of the division from one to the value.
each time find the difference between n and the i << 2
and calculate the nCr value for i + mod, i

Ex 
n = 6
6 / 4 = 1
so we just has one loop 
6 - 4 = 2 
(2 + 1)C(1) = 3 
what does 3 indicates here? 
it indicates putting 4 horizontal bricks and two vertical bricks, 
the two bricks has 3 cases, 2 on the left or two on the right or one left and one right. 



Ex 
n = 9
9 / 4 = 2
so we just has two loops
the first: 
9 - 4 = 5 
(5 + 1)C(1) = 6 
what does 6 indicates here? 
it indicates putting 4 horizontal bricks and five vertical bricks, 
5 on left and 0 on right
4 on left and 1 on right
3 on left and 2 on right
2 on left and 3 on right
1 on left and 4 on right
0 on left and 5 on right

the second: 
9 - 8 = 1 
(1 + 2)C(2) = 3 
what does 3 indicates here? 
it indicates putting 8 horizontal bricks (four and four)and one vertical bricks, 
1 on the left, 0 in the middle, and 0 at the right
1 on the left, 1 in the middle, and 0 at the right
0 on the left, 0 in the middle, and 1 at the right

and so on

then find the starting from 2 check how many numbers are prime and return this.
