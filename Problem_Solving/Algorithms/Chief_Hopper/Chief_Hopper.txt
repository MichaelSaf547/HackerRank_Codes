The problem is asking for a smallest number that multiplied by two and subtract the next number.

I reversed the array and started from the last number, 
assuming that we have zero after the last Subtraction operation.

Remember we reversed the array so, we will revers the operations.

First we divide the number by 2.
Second we add the previous number to it.

We have even flag to check that all the calculated digits (sub variable) are even if any of them is odd,
we know that we ignored a part of the value during division so after the whole operation are done, 
we add one.
