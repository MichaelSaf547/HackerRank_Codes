We store the values we can get the target values from 0 to n using the a two dimensional array

if we have a target value = 10
and an array of available digits with length  4, [2, 3, 5, 6]

so we create an array of [4][11]



	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	j
	
2	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1

3	1	0	1	1	1	1	2	1	2	2	2

5	1	0	1	1	1	2	2	2	3	3	4

6	1	0	1	1	1	2	3	2	4	4	5

i

Initialize the first column as ones. (we can get 0 from any number)

Then row by row, if we are in row 0 then we do not have any rows before so we
try to get the target num(1 -> n) using the number (c[i]) itself.

For the first line it is like you are using modulo operator for (c[0] == 2) (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

Starting from the second line and after we check if the number itself can be summed to get the target
and sum with the (value - line_value c[i]) can equal to the value (the upper value arr[i - 1][j])
