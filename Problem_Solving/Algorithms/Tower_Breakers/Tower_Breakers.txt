Any player will move from x to 1 to prevent the other player from playing 
So if the number of towers is odd, the first player will win
			: player1 tower1, tower3, ..., tower(n) the last one to play
			: player2 tower2, tower4, ..., tower(n - 1)
			
	and vice versa if the number of towers is even the second player will win.
	
	
Notice: if the towers height is 1 the first player will not have an option to play so he will lose,
		with no regards to the number of towers.
