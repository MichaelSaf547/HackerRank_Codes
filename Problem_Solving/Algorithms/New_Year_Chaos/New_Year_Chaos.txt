1- Move over the array and if any element is away of its place 
by more than 2 location break and print "Too chaotic".

2- If no element is away from its place by more than 2, we need to 
find how many numbers on the right of each element that is smaller than that element.

Ex. 2 1 5 3 4 

we start at 2: have 1 smaller 			--> 1
			1: have nothing smaller 	--> 1
			5: have 3, 4 smaller		--> 3
			3: have nothing smaller		--> 3
			4: have nothing smaller		--> 3
			
	So the result is 3.
	
So using mergesort, whenever an element on the right is 
smaller than an element on the left, sum the number of elements that will be moved.

Ex

	left 			right
	
1  2  5  7   	  3  4  8  6

so when we compare 5 and 3 we find the right element is smaller 
so add the length of the rest of the left array. Here it is 2 == (5, 7)
