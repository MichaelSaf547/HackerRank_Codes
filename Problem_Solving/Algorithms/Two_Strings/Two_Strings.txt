As the problem says that even if just one character exists 
in the two strings is enough to make the answer yes,

Create a string of just one character "a" and search for that in both, 
If found, return "YES". If not increase the char by 1 for "a" to "b" 
and so on till find a character that exists in both 
of them or get out of all characters > "z" then return "NO"
