As the game says that we play optimally, then whatever player 1 removes player 2 removes the same.

Ex 

3
1, 3, 7
so if player 1 removes 3 from 3, player 2 will remove 3 from 7. (1, 0, 4)
1 --> 001
3 --> 011
7 --> 111
After removing of 3 from the second and third pile: (1, 0, 4)
1 --> 001
0 --> 000
4 --> 100

If you notice it is like xor the second and the third pile.


So whenever the result of the xor of all values leads to 0 that means the second is the last one 
to play and win. otherwise that means at last just one pile will have value and player 1 will play and win.
