find_max_index function: is used to get the index of the max element.
Inputs: 1- int array ptr, the array to search in.
		2- int len, the length of the array.
		
Output: 1- the index of the maximum element in the array.

it start at location 0 and if finds a value larger than this location copy it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

stockmax function: is the core function. 
Inputs: 1- int prices_count, the array length.
		2- int prices, the array.
		
Output: 1- the maximum profit.

Find the index of the max element (that exists after the element i) in the array and check 
every time if this index is larger than this element index(i) 
				compare the value of the max with this element and 
					if max > element add the value to the result 
					else, ignore it.
			else, find the index of the new max (that exists after the element i) and
				compare the value of the max with this element and 
					if max > element add the value to the result 
					else, ignore it.		

Ex: 5, 4, 3, 4, 5	
inx:0, 1, 2, 3, 4

max index is 4 > 0, 
max - value[i] = 5 - 5 = 0 so ignore it.

max index is 4 > 1, 
max - value[i] = 5 - 4 = 1 so add it to the answer. answer = 1.

max index is 4 > 2, 
max - value[i] = 5 - 3 = 2 so add it to the answer. answer = 3.

max index is 4 > 2, 
max - value[i] = 5 - 4 = 1 so add it to the answer. answer = 4.		


Ex2: 1, 3, 1, 2	
inx: 0, 1, 2, 3

max index is 1 > 0, 
max - value[i] = 3 - 1 = 2 so add it to the answer. answer = 2.

max index is 1 == 1, so find the max in the rest of the array which result in index = 3, 
max - value[i] = 2 - 3 = -1 so ignore it.

max index is 3 > 2, 
max - value[i] = 2 - 1 = 1 so add it to the answer. answer = 3.
