Using Dynamic programming algorithm, set the first five values of the array,
then element by element if the elements of (index - 2, index - 3, index - 5), 
all have the value of 1 that mean that the second will win for sure so add zero in
this position and vice verse if any of the three values is zero add one to the index.
