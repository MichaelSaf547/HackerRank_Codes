1- Sort the input array using Mergesort algorithm.

2- Check if the p is smaller than the first element of the array, 
if yes then the max difference is arr[0] - p as any other element 
will have a higher value in the row, 
and from p to arr[0] all the values will be decreasing so no need to calc these values. 

Ex, if p = 5, q = 12, and the array = {10 , 15}
5: (10 - 5 = 5) (15 - 5 = 10)  --> 5 (arr[0] - p) 
6: (10 - 6 = 4) (15 - 6 = 9)   --> 4 (arr[0] - 6)
.								   3
.								   2
. 						
so till arr[0] the value will be decreasing, so we move i to arr[0] + 1

and if i is larger that arr[last_element], 
no need for calculation just (q - arr[last_element]) is the max (the verse of the above)

If i value is between two elements using while loop get these two elements and get the average of these
tow elements, this average is the farest value from both elements and move i to the higher element.

but notice here some cases: 
1- This average might be higher than q, so use q instead of mean.
2- mean is smaller than p(at the start), so use i instead of mean.
