i: is the index we are checking in the cities array.
start: is the first element that is needed to be electricaly covered. (start with 0)
prev: is the last element i can search in for the a city to use it. (start with -1)

we start with i = start + k - 1 trying to get the furthest city from the start
that if we used it, it would cover the start city also. 
Then we ask if it is 1(suitable for power plant) then fine we increase the res by 1,
 make the start equals to the this city plus k cities, 
 and make prev equals to this city(so we can not search in this city just after it). 

if the city was 0(not suitable), we start going back into cities till find the first city that equals to 1,
 and do the same as above.
But if we reached the prev value without finding a city that is suitable to power plant,
 we break and return 0.
