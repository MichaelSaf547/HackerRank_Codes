i: is an itreator over the array elements.
key: is a variable to indicate the largest value to be inserted.

1- Looping over the ith elements and the k(the number of swaps)
2- Check if the value of the element is equals to the key.
3- If yes: reduce th key value.
   If No: change the value of the of the ith element that equals the key with the compared element value.
		  by calling change function.
		  set the compared element value to the key value.
		  reduce the key value by 1.
		  reduce the avaliable number of swaps by 1.
4- Set the value of the *result_count to the array length.


change function: 
Inputs: 1- int * ptr: array to swap inside it.
		2- int len: length of the array.
		3- int change_num: the value to search for to change.
		4- int change_with: the value to change the value of the found ith element with. 
		
Search for the change_num and when find it, change it with the change_with and break.
