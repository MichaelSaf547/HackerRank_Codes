Read the number of strings.

Create an empty dictionary.

Loop over the length range and read the input string.

If the input is in the dictionary we increase the value of it by 1.

Else add the input string as a new key for the dictionary and assign it's value to 1. 

Then print the length of the dictionary and print the values of the dictionary keys.
