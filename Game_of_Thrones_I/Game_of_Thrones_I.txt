First, we found the how many of each characters are existed in the string.

Second, if the length is even then if any characters have odd number we break after makes the flag = 2,
		but if the flag still equals to 0 that means arr has all even numbers so we make it 1 to be YES.
		
Third, if the length is odd we search for only on index that have odd number, if we have more than one index 
		we make the flag = 2 and break.
